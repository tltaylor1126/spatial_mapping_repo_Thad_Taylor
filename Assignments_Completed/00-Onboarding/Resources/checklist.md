# ✅ Assignment 00 — Student Checklist

## Communication & Workflow Setup

> **If every box below is checked, you are done.**
> If something isn’t checked, that’s where you’re stuck.

---

## 🔹 PART 1 — Slack (Do This First)

- [ ] I joined the course Slack workspace
      (`griffin-courses.slack.com`)
- [ ] I am in the **correct class channel**
- [ ] I appear on the **class roster**
- [ ] My Slack **display name matches my real name**
- [ ] My Slack **profile image is a real photo of me**
  - [ ] Not an avatar
  - [ ] Not a logo
  - [ ] Not my pet
- [ ] I installed Slack on:
  - [ ] My computer
  - [ ] My phone (strongly recommended)

---

## 🔹 PART 2 — GitHub Repository

- [ ] I created a GitHub account
- [ ] I know my **GitHub username**
- [ ] I created a repository named something like:
      `     4543-Spatial-Data-and-Mapping
  `
- [ ] I checked **“Add a README.md”** when creating the repo
- [ ] My **root README.md** includes:
  - [ ] My first and last name
  - [ ] My email address
  - [ ] A photo of me (same rules as Slack)
  - [ ] Course name

---

## 🔹 PART 3 — Repo Structure

- [ ] I created this folder in my repo:
      `     Assignments/
  `
- [ ] Inside `Assignments/`, I created a `README.md`
- [ ] That README contains a table like this:

```markdown
|  #  | Folder Link | Assignment Description         |
| :-: | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
|  0  | A00         | Communication & Workflow Setup |
```

(Yes, it looks empty now. That’s normal.)

---

## 🔹 PART 4 — Communication Setup Form

- [ ] I filled out the Communication Setup Form
- [ ] I double-checked:
  - [ ] My name
  - [ ] My Slack name
  - [ ] My GitHub username
  - [ ] My **repo link** (not my profile link)

---

## 🔹 FINAL SELF-CHECK (Be Honest)

- [ ] I can message the instructor on Slack
- [ ] The instructor can click my repo link and see my work
- [ ] My repo clearly belongs to me
- [ ] I did **not** email the instructor

If all boxes are checked → **you are done** 🎉

---

## 🆘 If You’re Stuck

Before asking for help, identify **which checkbox you can’t check**.

When messaging on Slack, say:

> “I’m stuck on **Assignment 00 – Part X, Item Y**.”

That single sentence saves everyone time.

## 🧠 Why This Exists (Student Version)

This checklist exists so that:

- You don’t miss small but important steps
- You can confirm you’re finished without guessing
- Setup issues don’t derail actual course content

This is the last “boring” assignment for a bit.
Next up, we actually run code.
