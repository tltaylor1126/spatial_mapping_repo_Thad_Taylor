## 🔄 Workflow Overview

Here’s the “big picture” of how everything fits together:

<img src="https://images2.imgbox.com/da/47/e142Qpan_o.png" width="400">

Think of it like this:

1. **Instructor Repo** (`My Github Repo`) = where you get the assignments.
2. **Student's Repo** = your personal course repo with copies of all your code.
3. **Github Codespaces** = where you actually do the work online.
4. **Assignments → Completed** = A folder of all completed notebooks, or other docs as specified.
5. **D2L** = Where you also upload files when specified.

We can't use D2L as a work platform because this is a coding class, and D2L is extremely less than helpful with ... well anything (except grades) and uploading documents. So that's what we will use it for.

Below are the steps you need to take to get rolling. Most of you know about github and possibly codespaces, however, I will create a walkthrough here just in case.

## Steps

- [1. Create Your Own GitHub Repository](./01-Github-Repo.md)
- [2. Create a GitHub CodeSpace to code in](./02-CodeSpaces.md)
- [3. Get the Course Assignments](./02-Get_Assignments.md)
