# Codespaces

The documentation from Github to use a codespace is here: [VsCode CodeSpaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/developing-in-a-codespace) but I will also create a little getting started page here as well.

### Assumes

- Read [00-Workflow](./00-Workflow.md) overview.
- You have created your repository from [Part 01 Github-Repo](./02-CodeSpaces.md)

### Starting a Codespace

Below is a visual walkthrough for getting a CodeSpace setup. A CodeSpace is Github's version of a browser based development environment. It allows you to run code, but even better, it allows us to use iPython notebooks which is the major delivery system I have chosen. 

Click on an image to enlarge it. It should open in another tab. 

### 1️⃣

Simply open your own repository that you should have created by now.

### 2️⃣

When your repo is open, you should see a green button with the word "Code" on it. Click that button to get another dialogue box.

### 3️⃣

The dialogue box you just opened allows you to 1) Clone a repository (we will do this later) or 2) create your own CodeSpace. There are tabs at the top of the dialogue box which allow you to choose one or the other. Choose CodeSpaces, then "Create CodeSpace on main".

### 4️⃣

Once you click the button, it will open another tab in your browser and start to load the CodeSpace. It may take a little bit (minute or so). It feels slow, but it gets faster with subsequent openings.

You will see something akin to the image below. A file explorer on the left, a middle window that shows file contents (or code), and a terminal at the bottom of your screen.

If you see a CodeSpace with a file explorer, a main window, and a terminal you are ready for the next section: Making and Committing Changes
