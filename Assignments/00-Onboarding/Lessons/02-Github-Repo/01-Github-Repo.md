## 1. Create Your Own GitHub Repository

Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com) and sign in (or create a free account).

### After Registration

There are tons of docs to help you. and a link to install vscode if you want to work on your own computer (only if you know what your doing).

Your home page on github will have lots of help that is available if you need to use it. If not, goto the next section.

Click on it, to start creating your repository. You might see a button like \#1 in the graphic below. It doesn't matter as long as you eventually get to the \#2 page (as seen below as well).

#### Name your repository something like:

```
SpatialData-&-Mapping
```

Just make your repo name reflect the course.

### Organize Your Repo

Add these folders (the README is already there) at some point. It is wierd adding folders from the web interface, even though it is possible. You can wait until you open your repo in Codespaces to add folders though.

```
.
├── Assignments/              # Starter files (read-only templates)
├── Assignments_Completed/    # Your finished work goes here
└── README.md                 # Overview of your repo and yourself

```
